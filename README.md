## Getting Started
If you're completely new to programming, you may want to look into a tutorial. Before starting, you should already know the basics of programming such as variables, loops, dictionaries, and how to define functions, as well as how to run programs on your own machine.

Each project idea has a basic goal for you to achieve, as well as subgoals that require a bit more thought, but help make your program more interesting. The overall intent for this repository is to serve as a learning resource for everyone and to help transition learners from a beginning level to an intermediate level. In addition, learners are encouraged to contribute their solutions to this repository and thereby learn the basics of Git.

Almost all projects can be completed in any language, but some were specifically written to be completed with Python.

Remember, if you don't know how to do something, Google is your friend.

## Projects

### 99 Bottles
Create a program that prints out every line to the song "99 bottles of beer on the wall."
- Do not use a list for all of the numbers, and do not manually type them all in. Use a built in function instead.
- Besides the phrase "take one down," you may not type in any numbers/names of numbers directly into your song lyrics.
- Remember, when you reach 1 bottle left, the word "bottles" becomes singular.

### Magic 8 Ball
Simulate a magic 8-ball.
- Allow the user to enter their question.
- Display an in progress message(i.e. "thinking").
- Create 20 responses, and show a random response.
- Allow the user to ask another question or quit.

Bonus:
- Add a gui.
- It must have box for users to enter the question.
- It must have at least 4 buttons:
  - ask
  - clear (the text box)
  - play again
  - quit (this must close the window)

### Pythagorean Triples Checker
If you do not know how basic right triangles work, read [this article on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem).
- Allows the user to input the sides of any triangle in any order.
- Return whether the triangle is a Pythagorean Triple or not.
- Loop the program so the user can use it more than once without having to restart the program.

### Rock Paper Scissors Game
Create a rock-paper-scissors game.
- Ask the player to pick rock, paper or scissors.
- Have the computer chose its move.
- Compare the choices and decide who wins.
- Print the results.

Subgoals:
- Give the player the option to play again.
- Keep a record of the score (e.g. Player: 3 / Computer: 6).
